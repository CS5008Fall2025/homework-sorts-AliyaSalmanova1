How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 5-6 hours probably

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- for the algorithm problem, it was solved in group but I was the one who was coding. The group members gave me moral support and told me the bug, which was that I forgot to assign numsSize to *returnSize. Group 1 members are Karina Quenta, Siddharth Kakked, and Emily Despres (and me). 


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource
